            <p class="mt-5">Uruwala tea , which was originally introduced in 1920 , is shipped to many countries
                including Middle East countries and Russia , and it directly and indirectly employs close to 1000
                people. Tea plantations span about 75 acres, or about half of the Uruwala estate's total land area. Our
                annual production of tea is roughly 30000 Kilograms, and we manufacture it throughout the year. We as a
                member of the southern tea , offers you a variety of Ceylon tea flavors. It is greatly affected by the
                fact that it is predominantly handpicked. Despite our 100 years of excellence, we continue to prioritize
                using orthodox procedures. It still offers the greatest black tea, according to experts. Even with
                modern technology, we as experienced tea producers still use the traditional process, for the reason
                that best tea cannot be hurried. Making tea involves multiple steps, each of which takes a specific
                amount of time to output a quality product every minute is important. So let the water boil , KEEP CALM
                and let’s see how URUWALA TEA is produced!</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Camellia sinensis is the scientific name for the tea plant. They are grown as
                        bushes, solely as we want leaves. They are collected as often as the tea plant vegetates and
                        grows new shoots with leaves each year. Even though not all of the leaves are removed, tea is
                        manually collected. Only a few of the top, fresh, and juicy leaves were selected, together with
                        some of the stem on which they had developed and the so-called bud (or tip), which is an
                        unopened leaf at the end of the shoot. A few leaves, a piece of the stem, and a cap are referred
                        to as "flush." Flush is the cornerstone of tea production. Two or three leaves in a flush are
                        referred to as a "golden flush." The flushes are collected using three, four, or even five
                        leaves.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Tea leaves are transported from lush tea plantations to the factory, where they are
                        weighed as soon as they arrive. At the conclusion of the manufacturing process, the total weight
                        recorded for the day's batch serves as a baseline for quality evaluation. The tea is weighed and
                        then spread out to wither. We also purchase tea leaves from different vendors.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Tea leaves are spread out in huge withering troughs. To lower the moisture content
                        of leaves, heated air is used. About 42%-45% water is evoparated. Leaves undergo physical and
                        chemical changes essential to manufacture. Because excessive withering might be lethal, the
                        procedure is carefully watched. This would cause the leaf to become flaccid. The term "physical
                        wither" describes this. The breakdown of molecules into smaller units, which increases amino
                        acids and taste compounds, as well as the partial breakdown of cell walls, which is crucial for
                        later manufacturing stages, all take place during this period. For this chemical withering to
                        take place correctly, the plucked leaves wither for 12 to 18 hours.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Now that the leaf has withered, it can be rolled. The main objective of rolling is
                        to disrupt the leaf compartment or cells, releasing enzymes and bringing them into touch with
                        air so that aeration can begin. Dhool is the name for the crushed and rolled pieces of leaves.
                        Various kinds of rollers are utilized to do this. Since the initial roll is typically quite
                        soft, it is referred to as the "preconditioning roll." It has been determined that the delicate
                        expression of leaf juice on the surface of the twisted particles is the primary mechanism of the
                        preconditioning roll. The tea's dark tone is a result of these juices congealing on the surface
                        of the particles. The purpose of rolling after that is to completely destroy the leaf cells.
                        During the rolling phase, friction produces a lot of heat, but it's crucial to maintain the
                        temperature below 35 °C because greater temperatures could lead to unfavorable chemical and
                        enzyme interactions.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Through the impact of air on the leaf tissue, significant chemical reactions occur
                        during this crucial stage of production. Depending on a number of variables, including the
                        intended final output, the rolled, broken leaf is exposed for a time that ranges from 20 minutes
                        to five hours on tables. The most significant of these reactions is the oxidation of
                        polyphenols, which is brought on by the breakdown of cells, which enables the enzymes to combine
                        with the other chemical compounds inside the cell. Another event that takes place during
                        fermentation is the creation of certain flavor molecules. This phase has a significant impact on
                        flavor and color.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">To remove moisture and stop additional chemical alterations, the rolled leaves are
                        dried in a desiccator or "fire chamber" at 99-104 C (210-220 F). As a result, the leaf shrinks
                        and turns dark, yielding black tea. The actual manufacture is finished at this point.
                        Furthermore, the tea's flavor is "balanced," emphasizing the presence of more advantageous
                        higher boiling compounds, as some of the undesirable low boiling compounds are destroyed during
                        firing. Tea that has been dried should have a moisture content of 2.5% to 3%.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">The color and strength of the brew are affected by the size of the leaf particles in
                        your teapot, which has no bearing on the flavor of the beverage. A mechanical sifter is used to
                        grade manufactured tea according to leaf size. The largest pieces are found in "leaf" grades,
                        followed by "broken" grades that go progressively smaller, and finally "dust," which is the
                        smallest grade of all. Larger grades typically fetch larger bids at auction. Different tea
                        grades, such as OPA, OP, OP 1, PEKOE, PEKOE 1, FBOP, FBOPF, BOP, BOPA, FBOPF Ex SP, FBOPF SP,
                        BOPF, and DUST 1, are created by sifting dried leaves.</p>

                        Specific packaging is developed for each grade in accordance with its recognized criteria.

                        Using a CTC (cut, tear, and curl) equipment, which separates the withered leaf into incredibly
                        fine pieces, tea is processed for bagging. This broken-leaf infuses rapidly and creates a black,
                        robust brew, making it ideal for tea bags. Finally, our products are distributed in the market
                        as Uruwala tea. Perhaps your water has now boiled. Want to try the finest black tea from South
